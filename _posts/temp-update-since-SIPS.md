"Sorry to email you cold, I was wondering whether this SIPS session ever got worked into something?

One of the breakout rooms in that discussion group featured a few people from the Replicats project, which is an ongoing project to collect replicability estimates. It might be worth looking up, if you’re not already familiar. 

On my end, the learnings from that discussion group fed into a project at the eLIFE Sprint 2021, called MERITS, which was a fun little prototype of a multi-dimensional database for research contributions. You can see my 3 min intro to MERITS here (we also recorded a post-video summary of the prototype we built, but I’d have to search harder to find it). 

I learned a lot from that exercise and kept developing my ideas for a disruptive academic system, but eventually became frustrated with the lacklustre level of support and funding and decided to pivot out of academia to prototype elsewhere… in the festival space of all places. These ideas merged with another idea for a diverse ‘open science' festival and voila, Open Heart + Mind (OHM) was born: a safe container to test and explore new models for societal change. 

Here’s the README if you're interested. We’ve been prototyping and exploring autonomous community review systems for 2 years now, and are now building an app powered by what I think is a breakthrough model with potential to reshape academia, along with a host of other institutions. At least thats the position I’m writing up in a new paper and will be presenting at the upcoming AIMOS conference :) Let me know if I’ve piqued your interest ;)
