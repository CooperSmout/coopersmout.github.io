Hi, thanks for dropping by :)

My journey into science began at a Vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand (Wat Suan Mokkh), where I discovered a previously unexplored depth to my own mind and resolved to investigate consciousness from all angles -- both internal (meditation, mindfulness) and external (psychology, neuroscience). I returned home to complete an undergraduate degree in psychology, received honours in cognitive neuroscience ([plus a prize or two to boot](https://coopersmout.com/awards/)) and then finally started a PhD in the neural mechanisms of conscious awareness. My studies were going well until about halfway through the PhD, when I attempted to publish my first paper and was met with a [highly inefficient scholarly publishing system](https://aeon.co/ideas/scholarly-publishing-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it) that wastes researchers time, pressures researchers into compromising their integrity, and bleeds academia dry of funding. The more I looked into the state of academia, the more dismayed I became, with employment prospects for researchers being far worse than I had imagined. This shock threw me into a state of disillusionment -- if I carried down this path, would I be forced to compromise my scientific integrity to survive in academia? Did I really want to compete with friends and colleagues for too few funded positions? Everywhere I looked, I saw evidence of overworked and burned-out postdocs, many of whom had decided to leave academia after years of chasing short-term contracts around the world.

This disillusionment, coupled with other life stressors at the time, threw me into a deep depression that lasted the latter half of my PhD (incidentally, mental health problems are rife throughout academia). Since graduating, I've been clawing my way back to mental health, thanks in large part to [self-compassion meditation](https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#exercises) and finding hope in the open science movement, which aims to open the typically-closed processes in academia (e.g., publishing, peer review, data) to public scrutiny. As part of this process, I founded an open science [project](Project Free Our Knowledge) that I think could help researchers reclaim control of academia and restore balance in the research ecosystem, but after a year of trying (and failing) to get this project funded, I decided that my time would be better spent leaving academia altogether and procuring funding in my own way -- by playing [poker](/poker). In early 2021, I placed in a few good-sized tournaments and won an even bigger one, so my plan seems to be working out so far. And happily, I've just been offered some funding that will mean I can spend less time at the poker tables and more time on my true passion: creating a better academia for future generations of scientists to move into.

I'm also working on developing a healthy work-life balance (or at least much healthier than I had during my PhD!). Other things that keep me sane include: music, gardening, aquaponics, dancing, rockclimbing and spending time in nature.
