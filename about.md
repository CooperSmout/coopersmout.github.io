Hi, Dr Coops here. Thanks for dropping by. 

I studied an undergraduate in psychology and then a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, after discovering a deep fascination with the mind at a Vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand (Wat Suan Mokkh). Bright eyed and bushy tailed, I was planning to embark on a research career investigating the conscious mind from all angles -- meditation, psychology and neuroscience. Until, that is, I published my first paper and discovered a [horribly broken scholarly publishing system](https://aeon.co/ideas/scholarly-publishing-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it) that wastes researchers time, pressures them into compromising their integrity, and bleeds academia dry of funding. This shock threw me into a state of disillusionment and deep depression -- if I carried down this path, would I be forced to compromise my scientific integrity to survive in academia? Did I really want to compete with friends and colleagues for too few funded positions? 

I spent the next few years clawing my way out of depression, thanks in large part to [self-compassion meditation](https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#exercises) and finding hope in the open science movement, which aims to reform academia and free knowledge from the shackles of commercial servitude. After about a year of trying (and failing) to find funding for a new open science project that I founded, [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://freeourknowledge.org/), I decided that my time would be better spent by leaving academia altogether and procuring funding in my own way -- by playing [poker](/poker). In early 2021, I placed in a few good-sized tournaments and won an even bigger one, so I guess my plan is working out so far. And happily, I've just been offered some funding that will mean I can spend less time at the poker tables and more time on my true passion: creating a better academia for future generations of scientists to move into.

I'm also working on developing a healthy work-life balance (or at least much healthier than I had during my PhD!). Other things that keep me sane include: music, gardening, aquaponics, dancing, rockclimbing and spending time in nature.
