Hi, thanks for dropping by :)

My journey into academia began at a [Vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand](https://www.suanmokkh-idh.org/), where a newfound fascination with the human mind merged with a pre-existing interest in science, and I resolved to try and understand consciousness from all angles -- through philosophy, meditation, psychology and neuroscience. I returned home to complete an undergraduate degree (psychology) with honours in cognitive neuroscience ([plus a prize or two to boot](https://coopersmout.com/awards/)) and then embarked on a PhD exploring the neural mechanisms of conscious awareness. My studies were going well until about halfway through the PhD, when I attempted to publish my first paper and was met with a [highly inefficient scholarly publishing system](https://aeon.co/ideas/scholarly-publishing-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it) that wastes time nad resources, biases the literature and pressures researchers into compromising their integrity. The more I looked into the state of academia, the more dismayed I became, with employment prospects for researchers being far worse than I had ever imagined. This shock threw me into a state of disillusionment -- if I carried down this path, would I be forced to compromise my scientific integrity to survive in academia? Did I really want to compete with friends and colleagues for too few funded positions? Was the system even capable of sustaining me as I explored these esoteric but (in my opinion) important questions? Everywhere I looked, I saw evidence of overworked and burned-out postdocs, many of whom had decided to leave academia after years of chasing short-term contracts around the world.

This disillusionment, coupled with other life stressors at the time, threw me into a deep depression that lasted the latter half of my PhD (incidentally, mental health problems are rife throughout academia). Since graduating, I've been rebuilding my mental health and regaining balance, thanks in large part to [self-compassion meditation](https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#exercises) and finding hope in the [open science](/openscience) movement, which aims to create a fairer system while openning the research pipeline to public scrutiny. As part of this process, I joined the [Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education](https://igdore.org/) and founded a collective action platform that aims to help researchers reclaim control of academia and restore balance in the research ecosystem ([Project Free Our Knowledge](https://freeourknowledge.org/)). After a year of trying (and failing) to get this project funded, I realised my time would be better spent leaving 'traditional' academia and procuring funds in my own way -- by playing [poker](/poker). In early 2021, I placed in a few good-sized tournaments and am currently second on the national 'player of the year' standings, so my plan seems to be working out so far. In July 2021, I was offered some seed funding to support my open science projects and also began a part-time postdoc position at the Queensland Brain Institute, both of which will mean I can spend less time at the poker tables and more time on my true passion: creating a better academia for future generations of scientists to move into.

I'm also working on developing a healthy work-life balance (or at least much healthier than I had during my PhD!). Other things that keep me sane include: music, gardening, aquaponics, dancing, rockclimbing and spending time in nature.
