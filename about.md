Hi, thanks for dropping by :)

My journey into academia began at a [Vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand](https://www.suanmokkh-idh.org/), where I discovered a previously unimagined depth to my own mind and resolved to explore consciousness from all angles -- through philosophy, meditation, psychology and neuroscience. I returned home to complete an undergraduate degree in psychology and an [award-winning honours thesis](https://coopersmout.com/awards/) in cognitive neuroscience, before embarking on a PhD in the neural mechanisms of visual awareness. About halfway through the PhD, I attempted to publish my first paper and was shocked to discover a [highly inefficient scholarly publishing system](https://aeon.co/ideas/scholarly-publishing-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it) that wastes time and resources, biases the literature and pressures researchers into compromising their integrity. At the same time, I realised that employment prospects were far worse than I had ever imagined, throwing me into a state of disillusionment -- if I carried down this path, would I be forced to compromise my scientific integrity to survive in academia? Did I really want to compete with friends and colleagues for too few jobs? Was the system even capable of supporting me in my search for answers to these esoteric but important questions? Everywhere I looked, I saw evidence of overworked and burned-out researchers, many of whom had decided to leave academia after years of chasing short-term postdoc contracts around the world.

This disillusionment, coupled with other life stressors at the time, threw me into a deep depression that lasted the latter half of my PhD (incidentally, mental health problems are rife throughout academia). Since graduating, I've been rebuilding my mental health and regaining balance, thanks in large part to [self-compassion meditation](https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#exercises), dancing and finding hope in the [open science](/openscience) movement, which aims to create a fairer system while opening the research pipeline to public scrutiny. Toward the end of my PhD, I joined the [Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education](https://igdore.org/) and founded a collective action platform that aims to help researchers reclaim control of academia and restore balance in the research ecosystem ([Project Free Our Knowledge](https://freeourknowledge.org/)). After a year of trying (and failing) to get this project funded, I realised my time would be better spent leaving 'traditional' academia and procuring funds in my own way -- by playing [poker](/poker). In 2021, I placed in a few good-sized tournaments and came second on the national [player of the year](https://australianpokertour.com.au/index.php/player-of-the-year-update/) standings, so my plan seems to be working out so far. In July 2021, I was offered some seed funding to support my open science projects, which will mean I can spend less time at the poker tables and more time on my true passion: creating a better academia for future generations of scientists to move into.

Alongside this work I'm also working on developing a healthy work-life balance, which for me includes things like music, gardening, aquaponics, dancing, meditation, rockclimbing and spending time in nature.
