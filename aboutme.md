Hi, I'm Coops. Dr Coops.

I recently completed a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, investigating the neural mechanisms underlying conscious awareness through the application of machine learning and computational modelling techniques to neuroimaging data (mostly EEG and MEG). During my PhD, I was dismayed to discover that the scholarly publishing system is far from ideal, being unneccesarily expensive, privately-owned, slow, and inaccessible to the vast majority of people. Worse still, the system is biased toward sexy findings at the expense of reliability, placing pressure on early career researchers (like myself) to commit questionable research practices in their quest to get published and survive a competitive career in science. When I finished my PhD, I faced a choice: stay in academia and try to 'play the game', or leave my chosen field and try to fix the system. I chose the latter.

My first foray into this work has been the development of [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://freeourknowledge.org/) (FOK), the world's first collective action platform for researchers. In brief, Project FOK lets researchers pledge to take action *if and when a critical mass of their peers have pledged to take the same action*, thus overcoming the [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem) that binds researchers to the old way of doing things (journals, publishers, sequestering data and code, etc.). You can join the mailing list [here](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz), donate to the project [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rpjkz-test), or get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/projectFOK), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK) or [email](mailto:info@freeourknowledge.org). 

For the next stage of this work, I'll be returning to the research world, but with a focus on metaresearch (research on research) and the goal of developing new systems to disrupt the status quo. You can see a glimpse of what I'm planning [here](https://youtu.be/aKHMcTsO6Eg).
