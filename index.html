</p>

<br>I'm the founder and President of <a href="./OHM">Open Heart + Mind (OHM)</a>, a community and charity that uses gift-based festivals to prototype open and equitable models for society. Through this work, I've developed a generalizable peer-review framework based on open science principles that can adapt to the needs of diverse communities, bringing transparency and rigour to the way that people are recognized and rewarded for their contributions. I also founded <a href="https://freeourknowledge.org/">Free Our Knowledge</a>, an open source platform that organizes collective action on open research practices. Read more about my projects <a href="./projects">here</a>. 

<br><br>My <a href="./about">journey</a> into this work has been long and winding, beginning with architecture, pivoting at a meditation retreat, and passing through and out the other side of a PhD after I realised that the game of academia is broken and I didn't want to play it. I went rogue, playing <a href="./poker">poker</a> to fund my new dream of a fair and transparent research system and founding <a href="./OHM">OHM</a> to prototype and collect proof-of-concept data, before returning to academia. When I'm not playing poker or dreaming up solutions to complex problems, I try to maintain a healthy life balance through singing, dancing, rockclimbing, practicing yoga and meditating.
