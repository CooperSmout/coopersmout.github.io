### What I do
I'm the founder and President of [Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://openheartmind.org/), a citizen-science project and arts charity that uses gift-based festivals to prototype radically transparent models for society. Through this work, I've developed a generalizable framework based on open science principles that can adapt to the needs of diverse communities, bringing transparency and fairness to the way that people are recognized and rewarded for their contributions. I also founded Free Our Knowledge, an open source platform that helps researchers organize collective action on open research practices. Read more about my projects [here](https://coopersmout.github.io/projects/). 

### How I got here
My [journey](https://coopersmout.github.io/about/) into these projects was long and winding, beginning with architecture, turning at a meditation retreat, passing through a PhD and emerging out the other side, burned out and disillusioned with the current system. I turned out my dream job as a postdoc meditation researcher to pursue a new dream -- designing a new knowledge game that I want to play by, diving into entrepreneurialism and open source management as I went. When I'm not dreaming up creative solutions to complex problems, I try to maintain a healthy balance through singing, meditation, dance, rockclimbing and playing poker (my current [funding source](https://coopersmout.github.io/poker/)).
