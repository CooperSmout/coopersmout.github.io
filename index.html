<br>I'm the founder and President of <a href="https://openheartmind.org/">Open Heart + Mind (OHM)</a>, a charity project using gift-based festivals to prototype new models for society. My main focus is WISDOM, a generalizable open review framework designed from first principles to revolutionize the way communities recognize and reward contributions. Read more about my projects <a href="./projects">here</a>. 

<br><br>My <a href="./about">journey</a> to this point has been long and winding, beginning with architecture, pivoting at a meditation retreat, and passing through a PhD and out the other side when I realised that the game of academia is broken. Since then, I've been playing <a href="./poker">poker</a> to fund my new dream of a fair and open research system where everyone gets to play. Read more about my journey <a href="./poker">here</a>.
