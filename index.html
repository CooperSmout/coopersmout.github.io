<br>I'm the founder and President of <a href="https://openheartmind.org/">Open Heart + Mind (OHM)</a>, a charity and community who co-create inclusive gatherings as a safe space to prototype new models for society. My main focus is WISDOM, an open review, recognition and reward framework that we've prototyped through OHM and now generalized to academia. I also founded Free Our Knowledge, a collective action platform for open science practices (see my <a href="./projects">projects</a> page for more details). 

<br><br>My <a href="./about">journey</a> to this point began in architecture, pivoted at a meditation retreat, and passed through a neuroscience PhD and out the other side when I realised that the game of academia is broken. Since then, I've been playing a different kind of <a href="./poker">game</a> to fund my dream of a fair and open research system, where everyone gets to play (learn more about my journey <a href="./about">here</a>).
