<br>I'm the founder and President of <a href="https://openheartmind.org/">Open Heart + Mind (OHM)</a>, a charity community creating diverse gatherings as a safe space to prototype transformative models for society. My passion project is WISDOM, an open review, recognition and reward framework for diverse communities (see more on my <a href="./projects">projects page</a>). 

<br><br>My career journey began in architecture, pivoted at a meditation retreat, and passed through and out the other side of a PhD when I realised that the academic game is broken. Since then, I've been playing a different kind of <a href="./poker">game</a> to fund my dream of a fair open science system, where everyone gets to play (more on my journey <a href="./about">here</a>).
