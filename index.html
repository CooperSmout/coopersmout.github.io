<br>I'm the founder and President of <a href="./OHM">Open Heart + Mind (OHM)</a>, a community and charity that uses gift-based festivals to prototype radically transparent models for society. Through this work, I've developed a generalizable peer-review framework based on open science principles that can adapt to the needs of diverse communities, bringing transparency and fairness to the way that people are recognized and rewarded for their contributions. I also founded <a href="https://freeourknowledge.org/">Free Our Knowledge</a>, an open source platform that helps researchers organize collective action on open research practices. Read more about my projects [here](/projects). 

### How I got here
My <a href="./about">journey</a> into these projects was long and winding, beginning with architecture, turning at a meditation retreat, and passing through and out the other side of a PhD after realising that the game of academia is fundamentally broken. I went rogue, playing <a href="./poker">poker</a> to fund my new dream of a fair and transparent research system and founding <a href="./OHM">OHM</a> to prototype and collect proof-of-concept data. When I'm not playing poker or dreaming up creative solutions to complex problems, I try to maintain a healthy balance through singing, dancing, rockclimbing, practicing yoga and meditating.
