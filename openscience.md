Here are the various open science projects I'm currently working on. Until I can figure out a more sustainable revenue stream for this work, I'll be funding it by playing [poker](/poker). 

## Project Free Our Knowledge
_The world's first collective action platform for researchers_

Open science practices have the potential to radically transform the way scientists conduct and communicate their research. Unfortunately, hyper-competition between academics keeps us locked into the old way of doing things (e.g., journals, publishers, sequestering data/code, etc.) and limits the full embrace of digital communication made available by the internet. Project Free Our Knowledge (FOK) aims to overcome this cultural inertia (otherwise known as a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem)) by organising collective action between researchers on a global scale. Using our [website](https://freeourknowledge.org/), researchers can pledge to take action *subject to there being a critical mass of their peers who have agreed to take the same action*. By acting together, we hope to accelerate the adoption of open science practices in academia, while protecting and motivating those individuals who feel unable to take action on their own. 

Join the mailing list [here](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz), donate to the project [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rpjkz-test), or get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/projectFOK), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK) or [email](mailto:info@freeourknowledge.org). See the [presentations page](/presentations) for a list of conferences and workshops I've presented these ideas at.

## A database for storing machine-readable article ratings
In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in post-publication peer-review, with many models proposing [multidimensional article-level ratings](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00079) as an alternative to unidimensional journal-level metrics (e.g, the journal impact factor). In line with these ideas, a growing number of preprint review platforms solicit reviewersâ€™ ratings of preprints on multiple dimensions (e.g. PREreview, Rapid Reviews Covid-19), but these ratings typically remain siloed within each project, thus limiting their interoperability, searchability, and comparison between sites. 

, and prevents research that could otherwise be conducted into the nature of these ratings and how they relate to real-world outcomes (e.g. citations, patents, replicability), and limiting accessibility to these evaluations by various stakeholders in society (e.g. researchers, journalists who may wish to understand new COVID research). 

Here, we propose to develop a central database for organising and storing article ratings in a common, machine-readable format. We anticipate that this database will facilitate: (1) metaresearch into the nature of these ratings and how they relate to real-world outcomes (e.g. citations, patents, replicability); (2) researchers/journalists who wish to find peer ratings of articles/preprints (e.g., new COVID-related research).

## Understanding bias in peer review
I'm also developing ideas for a new line of metaresearch (research on research) on the types of judgements experts make during peer review, which I hope will one day evolve into a more open, inclusive, researcher-controlled system of scholarly communication and evaluation. You can see a glimpse of what I'm planning [here](https://youtu.be/aKHMcTsO6Eg).
