I learned some time ago that I could play poker profitably. I also learned that I didn't want to make it my career, because it doesn't fill me with purpose. Instead, I went into research -- bright eyed and bushy tailed -- thinking that this was the best way I could make a difference. In the years since, I've lost count of the number of times I've attended career guidance sessions for early career researchers (ECRs), in which senior academics have advised us to have a 'backup plan' or 'side hustle' in case academia doesn't work out. Why are we training so many ECRs for positions that don't exist? Why are we wasting all those resources developing skills that will never be used? For these and other reasons, I've reached the conclusion that academia is not actually the best way to make a difference, and so my new plan is to try to fix it from the outside by developing open science projects. Because this work isn't cheap, my new plan is to leverage my poker skills to fund the projects -- at least until I can find a more sustainable revenue source.
