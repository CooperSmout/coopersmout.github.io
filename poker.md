It's becoming increasingly common for early-career researchers (ECRs) to be advised, at conferences and workshops etc., to make sure they have a 'backup plan' or 'side hustle' in case academia doesn't work out for them. It's a sad fact that there are far more aspiring researchers than research positions, and the situation looks to be getting worse rather than better. For me, I was fortunate enough to already have a side-hustle, because I learned early in my undergraduate days that I can play Texas Holdem poker profitably at the casino. Of course, I didn't expect to be relying on it for income, because I had chosen instead to pursue a career in research. But now that I've decided academia isn't for me and that I'd rather try to fix it from the outside, I'm returning to the felt to fund my various open science projects (e.g., [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://freeourknowledge.org/)).
