I've lost count of the number of times I've been advised, along with other early-career researchers (ECR), to have a 'backup plan' or 'side hustle' in case we can't get a job or academia doesn't work out. Well, academia hasn't worked out for me -- not because I couldn't find a postdoc position (actually, I didn't really look), but because I think the system is broken and I'd rather try to fix it from the outside than 'play the game' from within. To fund this work -- at least until it becomes self-sustainable in its own right -- I'll be returning to an old side-hustle from my undergraduate days: Texas Holdem Poker. You can see my live tournament results [here](https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&n=585943) and some recent final table performances [here](https://fb.watch/3dq0ZmVWkX/) and [here](https://fb.watch/4f3_JWuVZf/). All profits will go toward supporting [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://freeourknowledge.org/)).
