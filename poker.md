It's becoming increasingly common for early-career researchers (ECRs) to be advised, at conferences and workshops etc., to make sure they have a 'backup plan' or 'side hustle' in case academia doesn't work out for them. It's a sad fact that there are far more aspiring researchers than research positions, and the situation looks to be getting worse rather than better. Gratefully, I realised early in my undergraduate days that I can play Texas Holdem poker profitably, and so already have a side-hustle to fall back on. Of course, I didn't expect to be relying on it for income, because I chose instead to pursue a career in research. But now that I've left academia and am in need of funding for my open science projects, I've decided to return to the felt as a way to fund these projects until they can become self-sustainable in their own right.
