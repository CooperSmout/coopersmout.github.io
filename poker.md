title: Poker
subtitle: Every ECR needs a side-hustle
---

I learned some time ago that I could play poker profitably. I also learned that I didn't want to make it my career, because it doesn't fill me with purpose. Instead, I went into research, bright eyed and bushy tailed that this was my way to make a difference. Ironically, then, I was cautioned at multiple conferences and early career researcher (ECR) workshops to be prepared with a 'backup plan' or 'side hustle' in case academia doesn't work out. Well, it hasn't worked out, primarily because I no longer believe it's the best way to make a difference. So, instead of pursuing a traditional career in academia, my new plan is to develop open science projects to try and fix academia itself. To fund this work, I'll be playing poker -- at least until I can find a sustainable funding/revenue source.
