Early career researchers are often advised, at conferences and such, to have a 'backup plan' or 'side hustle' in case academia doesn't work out for them. Personally, I'd rather hear about solutions than backup plans, because I didn't spend years training to get into academia just to get out of it! But anyway, now that I've decided to [forgoe traditional academia and try to fix it from the outside](/about), it looks like I'll be needing that side hustle after all. Luckily, I figured out in my undergraduate days that I could play Texas Holdem Poker profitably, and in the years since have been honing my skills alongside my studies. So, in the short term -- at least until I can find a more sustainable revenue stream -- I'll be funding my [open science projects](/openscience) by returning to the felt. I find it particularly ironic that I'll be using game theory (in poker) to try and solve the mother of all game theory problems in academia -- the [collective action problem](http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/collective-action-problems/) that prevents researchers from embracing open science practices. Wish me luck ;)
