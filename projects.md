## WISDOM
_Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Metrics_

WISDOM is a generalizable framework that began as a transformative scholarly publishing model and evolved through active experimentation at OHM Gatherings to become a generalizable framework for diverse, self-organizing communities. By creating a fair, transparent system for recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM empowers contributors and connects diverse communities with aligned goals.

At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol with immediate rewards for contribution reviews, which are converted into group-level metrics showing the diverse qualities of contributions. Contributors are then rewarded with tokens representing the value of their contibutions, and metrics representing their expertise or reliability. The entire process is open, decentralized and autonomous, ensuring everyone can participate while guarding against bias and gaming through a novel self-referential meta-review design.

## OHM Gathering
_Diverse festivals co-created by the Open Heart + Mind Community_

We face incredible challenges as a global society, but the current political and information systems have proven woefully inadequate to deal with them. Never before has it been so critical that we come together and build new systems based on transparency, reliability, equity, diversity, inclusion, and compassion, so that we can avert catastrophic climate change and transition to a harmonious way of life for all beings on this planet. In the wake of COVID, it has become clear that we need more spaces for diverse people to come together and share their ideas in a non-judgemental format. 

OHM Gatherings are diverse and inclusive spaces where people can share their art, ideas, wisdom, goods and services with the community. OHM gatherings are based on Burning Man principles (e.g., Gifting, Self-expression, Inclusion) and serve as a safe space to prototype transformative models for society. To date, we've hosted [several gatherings](https://openheartmind.org/community/) of different shapes and sizes, conducted open-peer review of contributions and fed these learnings into WISDOM. Our overarching goal with this project is to develop transparent contribution templates that people around the world can use to replicate our gatherings in a decentralised and autonomous fashion. 

## Free Our Knowledge
_The world's first collective action platform for researchers_

Open science practices have the potential to radically transform the way scientists conduct and communicate their research. Unfortunately, hyper-competition between academics keeps us locked into the old way of doing things (e.g., journals, publishers, sequestering data/code, etc.) and limits the full embrace of digital communication made available by the internet. 

[Project Free Our Knowledge](https://freeourknowledge.org/) aims to overcome this [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem) by organising critical masses of researchers to act together. Using our [open source website](https://freeourknowledge.org/), researchers can pledge to take action *if and when a critical mass of pledges is reached*. By acting together, we hope to accelerate the adoption of open science practices in academia, while protecting those individuals who feel unsafe to act on their own. 

After founding and leading this project for four years, I handed it over to a new board in 2023 so I could focus on OHM. See our [website](https://freeourknowledge.org/) for current campaigns and my [presentations](/presentations) for conferences where I've shared these ideas.

## MERITS
_Metaresearch Evaluation Repository to Identify Trustworthy Science_

In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in post-publication peer-review, with many models proposing [multidimensional article-level ratings](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00079) as an alternative to unidimensional journal-level metrics (e.g, the journal impact factor). In line with these ideas, a growing number of preprint review platforms solicit reviewersâ€™ ratings of preprints on multiple dimensions (e.g. PREreview, Rapid Reviews Covid-19), but these ratings typically remain siloed within each project, thus limiting their interoperability, searchability, and comparison between sites. 

MERITS is a prototype database for organising and storing article ratings in a common, machine-readable format. We anticipate that this database will: (1) facilitate meta-research into the nature of these ratings and how they relate to real-world outcomes (see below), (2) help various stakeholders in society (e.g., researchers, journalists, the general public) identify peer-rated research and assess it accordingly (e.g., new COVID-related preprints), and (3) foster innovation in scholarly evaluation and publication. 

I co-led this project at the 2021 eLife Innovation Sprint, feeding those learnings into what would eventually become the WISDOM framework. You can learn more about MERITS [here](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/projects2021/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ee4ESnzI40)

## Meta-research
In parallel to MERITS, I was also developing a meta-research (research on research) paradigm into the types of judgements experts make during peer review. This research paradigm would aim to explore (a) what dimensions/characteristics researchers are interested in when they evaluate research, (b) how these dimensions can best be captured during a structured peer review process, (c) how these dimensions relate to one another, (d) how these dimensions relate to real-world outcomes (e.g., citations, patents), among other questions. My plan was to evolve this line of research alongside the MERITS database and other projects, with the view to develop an open, inclusive, evidence-based, researcher-controlled system of scholarly communication and evaluation. You can see a glimpse of what I was planning [here](https://youtu.be/aKHMcTsO6Eg). Through the process of developing this line of research, I realised that I could make faster progress outside of academia, and hence [Open Heart + Mind](https://openheartmind.org) was born.
